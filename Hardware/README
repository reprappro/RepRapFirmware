Custom hardware tree for the Duet platform (version 1.0.3)


This tree is based upon the official "Arduino Due" 1.6.4 platform files, however the following changes were made:

- WString class is no longer present in the Arduino core. Use char arrays in conjunction with StringRef containers instead
- EMAC RX buffers were increased to 128*32 for optimal network performance
- UART classes were expanded by a "canWrite" method for better sending performance


To include this hardware tree, open the Arduino IDE.  Open the Boards Manager and install the Due device tree.  Then
go to File -> Preferences and set "Additional Boards Manager URLs" to:

  https://github.com/chrishamm/RepRapFirmware/raw/dev/Hardware/package_reprap_index.json
  
Then open the Boards Manager and install the Duet device tree.

Many thanks to David Crocker aka dc42 for providing the initial Arduino core patches!
